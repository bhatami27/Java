Complications

Payment
Reimburshment
Blacklist
GiftMiles Due to time constraints in other facts that comes into not being able to meet face to face, we had a really hard time coming up with a way for our program to excute the desire methods. If the program user doesn't have all the necessary files and txts mentioned above then the program issued no directroy. It seems as if the program made it's own direcotry that we need to have in the file.
